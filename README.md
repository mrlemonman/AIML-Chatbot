# Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Flask
py2neo
nltk
scikit-learn
joblib
bcrypt
You can install the required packages using pip:

cd chatbot-project
Set up the Neo4j database:

Install Neo4j locally and start the Neo4j server.

Modify the following line in main.py to match your Neo4j configuration:

python
Copy code
graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "12345678"))
Train the AIML models:

Place your AIML files inside the data directory.

Uncomment the line in main.py that loads the AIML files:

python
Copy code
# k.learn("data/" + filename)
Train the gender detection model:

Prepare a dataset containing names and their corresponding genders.
Train a gender detection model and save it as gender_detect.pkl.
Prepare a vocabulary for the CountVectorizer and save it as vocabulary.pkl.
Run the application:

shell
Copy code
python main.py
The chatbot will be accessible at http://localhost:8001.
